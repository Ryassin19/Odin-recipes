    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="first">Lasagna, also known in its plural form as lasagne, is a type of pasta made in very wide, flat sheets. It is possibly one of the oldest forms of pasta. In traditional Italian cuisine, lasagna is prepared by stacking layers of these pasta sheets with a variety of fillings. Common fillings include ragù (a meat-based tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, and cheeses such as ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. The dish is usually seasoned with herbs and spices to enhance the flavor.</p>
    <p class="second">Once assembled, the layered pasta is often topped with grated cheese, which melts and browns during baking. The entire dish is then baked in an oven, a process referred to in Italian as “al forno.” After baking, the lasagna is typically cut into square or rectangular portions for serving. The combination of rich sauces, creamy cheeses, and tender pasta makes lasagna a popular and comforting dish in many cuisines around the world.</p>
