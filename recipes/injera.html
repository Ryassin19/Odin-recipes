    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="first">Injera is a traditional Ethiopian and Eritrean flatbread made from teff flour, a tiny, nutrient-rich grain native to the Horn of Africa. It has a soft, spongy texture and a slightly sour taste, the result of a natural fermentation process that lasts several days. The batter is poured onto a hot, flat pan and cooked on one side, creating a surface covered in tiny holes, perfect for soaking up sauces and stews.</p>    
    <p class="second">Injera is more than just breadâ€”it also serves as a utensil. Large rounds of injera are typically spread out on a platter and topped with various dishes like lentils, vegetables, and spiced meats. Pieces are torn off by hand and used to scoop up the food. Its unique texture and tangy flavor make injera a central and symbolic part of East African meals and culture.</p>
