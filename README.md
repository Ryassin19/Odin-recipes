# Odin-recipes
This project is part of the Foundations course from The Odin Project. It is a basic recipe website built using only HTML. The main goal of this project is to practice creating web pages and linking multiple pages together.

The website has a main index page with links to different recipe pages. Each recipe page has a heading with the recipe name, an image of the dish, a short description, a list of ingredients, and the steps to make the recipe. The index page links to all the recipes, and each recipe page has a link back to the home page for easy navigation.

This project is focused on building the HTML structure and understanding how to organize content across multiple pages. Styling and layout improvements will be added later with CSS.

By completing this project, you will practice creating a multi-page website, working with headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links, and organizing your project in a GitHub repository.
